I conducted a series of Offensive Security engagement activities on a simulated infrastructure designed to mirror the structure of a corporate environment with a multi-platform architecture. This included performing penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and exploit simulations across various platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and web-based systems. By using a combination of manual techniques and automated tools, I identified potential security weaknesses, tested network defenses, and assessed the effectiveness of the organization's security posture across different environments. These engagements were tailored to mimic real-world cyberattack scenarios, helping to uncover vulnerabilities in the system architecture and providing valuable insights into improving defense mechanisms and response protocols. The activities also included comprehensive reporting on findings, actionable recommendations, and assessment of the organizationâ€™s overall security strategy in handling multi-platform threats.

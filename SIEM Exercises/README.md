I developed comprehensive reports, alerts, and monitoring dashboards within Splunk, alongside custom applets, to mirror the corporation's objective operational functionality. These tools were designed to emulate detection systems and simulate real-time attacks, specifically targeting Apache webserver platforms and Windows-based user access monitoring. By leveraging Splunk's robust capabilities, I created an environment that allowed for the detection and analysis of security incidents, providing detailed insights into system performance, user activity, and potential vulnerabilities. This initiative enhanced the corporation's ability to monitor its infrastructure effectively, enabling proactive threat identification and response in real-time.

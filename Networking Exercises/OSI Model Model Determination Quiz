A networking cable was cut in the data center and now no traffic can go out.


A code injection was submitted from an administrative website, and it's possible that an attacker can now see unauthorized directories from your Linux server.


The MAC address of one of your network interface cards has been spoofed and is preventing some traffic from reaching its destination.


Your encrypted web traffic is now using a weak encryption cipher, and the web traffic is now vulnerable to decryption.


The destination IP address was modified and traffic is routed to an unauthorized location.


A flood of TCP requests is causing performance issues.


A SQL injection attack was detected by the SOC. This SQL injection may have deleted several database tables.


A switch suddenly stopped working, and local machines aren't receiving any traffic.


An ethernet cable was disconnected, and the machine connected isn't able to receive any external traffic.


Traffic within the network is being directed from the switch to a suspicious device.

Here's the breakdown of the OSI Model Layer associated with each scenario:

1. **A networking cable was cut in the data center and now no traffic can go out.**
   - **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)**: This layer deals with the physical connection and transmission of raw data bits over a physical medium (in this case, a networking cable being cut).

2. **A code injection was submitted from an administrative website, and it's possible that an attacker can now see unauthorized directories from your Linux server.**
   - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Code injections typically exploit vulnerabilities in applications or software (which operate at the application layer) to execute unauthorized commands or access unauthorized data.

3. **The MAC address of one of your network interface cards has been spoofed and is preventing some traffic from reaching its destination.**
   - **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**: MAC addresses are associated with the data link layer, which handles the addressing of devices at the local network level.

4. **Your encrypted web traffic is now using a weak encryption cipher, and the web traffic is now vulnerable to decryption.**
   - **Layer 6 (Presentation Layer)**: The presentation layer deals with data encryption and decryption, and the use of weak encryption ciphers would compromise the confidentiality of the data.

5. **The destination IP address was modified and traffic is routed to an unauthorized location.**
   - **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**: IP addresses are handled at the network layer, which is responsible for routing and forwarding data packets based on IP addresses.

6. **A flood of TCP requests is causing performance issues.**
   - **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) operates at the transport layer, managing communication between applications by ensuring reliable and ordered delivery of data packets.

7. **A SQL injection attack was detected by the SOC. This SQL injection may have deleted several database tables.**
   - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: SQL injection attacks target applications that use SQL databases (operating at the application layer) to manipulate data, potentially causing data loss or unauthorized access.

8. **A switch suddenly stopped working, and local machines aren't receiving any traffic.**
   - **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**: Switches operate at the data link layer and are responsible for forwarding data frames within a local area network.

9. **An Ethernet cable was disconnected, and the machine connected isn't able to receive any external traffic.**
   - **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)**: The physical layer manages the actual physical connection between devices, including Ethernet cables.

10. **Traffic within the network is being directed from the switch to a suspicious device.**
    - **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**: Switches use MAC addresses (data link layer addresses) to determine where to forward network traffic within a local area network.

1 - Log into your UFW container and firewalld container with docker commands. firewalld will serve as your attack machine for this activity, and UFW as the victim.
  Set up your test environment. Type the following commands in your UFW container:

    sudo ufw reset
    sudo ufw enable
    sudo ufw default deny incoming
    sudo ufw default deny outgoing
    sudo ufw allow 80
    sudo ufw allow 22
    sudo ufw allow 443

2 - From your firewalld container, perform a basic Nmap scan against the UFW machine to help you determine whether the system is alive or not:
      nmap 172.16.18.72

    Which ports are open, and what are their associated protocols and service types?
        port 22/tcp ssh, port 80/tcp http, port 443/tcp https

3 - Run the command that returns results that include service and daemon type:
      sudo nmap -sV 172.16.18.72

    What versions are returned in the results if any?

  [In this case:]
======================================================================================================
      22/tcp  open   ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
      80/tcp  open   http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
      443/tcp closed http
======================================================================================================
  Why was Nmap able to enumerate these services?
    Because the ports are open and active.



4 - With the ufw firewall still enabled, type the command that performs OS detection and service detection using fast execution.
    sudo nmap -A -T4 172.16.18.72
  
  Was this nmap scan able to determine which distribution of Linux is running on the host and if so, which one?
    Yes, Ubuntu

  Was this nmap scan able to return an exact match for the OS on the host?
    No, the nmap scan returned "No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal)".

5 - Run uname -a.

    Does the currently installed version of Linux match any of the versions within the "Aggressive OS guesses" section of the nmap scan?
      No

6 - Run the Nmap command that will determine whether or not a firewall is stateful:
      sudo nmap -sA 172.16.18.72

  What are the port states?
    Unfiltered

  What type of firewall is being used and at which layer of the OSI model does it operate?
    The firewall is stateful, and operates at OSI Layers 3 and 4.

6 - What is a SYN scan and what is its primary benefit, from a hacking perspective?
    The TCP SYN scan, also known as “half-connect scan” sends a SYN packet to the victim.  This scan is beneficial from a hacking perspective because of its stealth, since it does not complete the TCP three-way handshake.

7 - What are the three possible responses of a SYN Scan and what do they mean?
      SYN/ACK: Port is open, meaning the attacker can use this port.
      RST: The port is closed.
      No response: The port is filtered, meaning there’s a firewall protecting it. The port is most likely open but is protected by the firewall.

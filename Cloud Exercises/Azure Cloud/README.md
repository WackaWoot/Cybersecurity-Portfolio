I designed and implemented a series of microservices within a virtual environment using Docker, Ansible, and Microsoft Azure to simulate a basic website and associated infrastructure. This environment replicated key elements of a production network, including network infrastructure groups, web application firewalls (WAF), and firewall control protocols. I utilized Docker to containerize microservices, ensuring efficient scalability and isolation, while leveraging Ansible for automated configuration management and deployment across the environment. In Microsoft Azure, I set up the virtual network architecture to mirror real-world cloud infrastructures, ensuring seamless communication between services. Additionally, I incorporated bin/bash scripts for headless server control, enabling efficient system management and automation without a graphical user interface. This setup provided a comprehensive testing environment for understanding the interactions between network security layers, application components, and infrastructure, while enabling testing of security controls and operational practices in a controlled, scalable virtual environment.

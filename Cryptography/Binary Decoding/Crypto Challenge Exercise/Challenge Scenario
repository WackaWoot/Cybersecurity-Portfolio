Scenario 

You are a Cybersecurity Analyst at Nakatomi Hospital. Unfortunately, a doctor opened up an email containing ransomware.

The ransomware spread throughout the hospital and encrypted all patient records. The ransomware has given you two options to decrypt and retrieve your patient records:

Pay 100 Bitcoins  

Solve 6 Riddles

Since you refuse to pay off any ransom, you will need to act fast to solve the six riddles from the ransomware. The doctors need to access the patient records! Lives are at stake!


Instructions

The ransomware encrypted the patient records and provided you with six different riddles. These riddles can be found in the above toolbar. To solve each riddle, cryptography concepts will need to be applied.

Once the riddle has been solved, submit your answer on the bottom of each riddle page. If the correct answer is provided, a key will be given.

Keep track of all of your keys. Once they are all obtained, select the RANSOMWARE DECRYPTER link above and enter in all of your keys!

Good luck and act fast. The Nakatomi patients are counting on you!

I presented the deauthentication vulnerabilities of the Tapo L530E smart LED light bulb using Kali Linux and tools such as Zenmap/Nmap, Aireplay-ng, Aircrack-ng, Wireshark, Nessus, Arping, and basic network commands. The identified vulnerabilities, rated with a CVSS score of 7.5+, correspond to CVE-2023-38906, CVE-2023-38908, and CVE-2023-38909, and remain present in both unpatched (out-of-box) and patched (firmware-updated) devices. Additionally, I discovered the ability to manipulate these devices using hacking tools, such as the Flipper Zero outfitted with the Marauder firmware, further exposing their security weaknesses.
